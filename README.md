## Case Overview:

- “Vidsi” is a new video streaming service you are building for a startup company.
-	Subscribers sign up for free and receive 2 hours of free streaming
-	For paid subscribers, streaming limits are based on plan tier
-	There are currently 3 tiered subscription plans - but they may change in the future
-	There’s a catalog of videos to stream that are licensed from different content providers
-	Subscribers stream videos and we need to store information about what’s being streamed
-	We need to generate monthly invoices for subscribers that can be paid by credit card on file or by check
-	For subscribers charged by credit card we need to store payment information (you can assume security and PCI compliance don’t exist - you can store credit card numbers to charge)
-	Licenses with content providers only allow for a certain number of concurrent subscribers to watch a given video
