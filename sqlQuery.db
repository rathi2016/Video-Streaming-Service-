1.Creating a new table which consist of two Foreign keys user_id and video_id.

sqlite> CREATE TABLE streamed (
   ...> id INTEGERS PRIMARY KEY,
   ...> user_id INTEGERS,
   ...> video_id INTEGERS);
2.Inserting value in my database created

sqlite> INSERT INTO streamed (user_id, video_id) VALUES (1,1);
sqlite> INSERT INTO streamed (user_id, video_id) VALUES (1,2);
sqlite> INSERT INTO streamed (user_id, video_id) VALUES (1,1);
sqlite> INSERT INTO streamed (user_id, video_id) VALUES (2,1);

4.SQL query to return all the video/user pairings. In other words, show which
videos have been most re-watched by a single user.

sqlite> SELECT user_id, video_id,
   ...> COUNT(*) As CountOf
   ...> FROM streamed
   ...> GROUP BY user_id, video_id
   ...> HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1
   ...> ;

   OUTPUT
   user_id|video_id|Views
   1      |1        |2
   1      |2        |1
   2      |1        |1

REQUIREMENT:

3.SQL query to return the top 20 video/user pairings. In other words, show which
videos have been most re-watched by a single user.

   sqlite> SELECT user_id, video_id,
   ...> COUNT(*) As CountOf
   ...> FROM streamed
   ...> GROUP BY user_id, video_id
   ...> HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1
   ...>  LIMIT 20
   ...> ;
